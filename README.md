# Marketing Mix Modeling with Python

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** using Python. MMM is a statistical analysis technique used to estimate the impact of various marketing channels on sales. The notebook was prepared as part of a lecture delivered at **Universidad Galileo** and guides users through the process of loading marketing data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building regression models to estimate the influence of TV, radio, and newspaper ads, and visualizing the results to inform marketing budget allocation.

## Project Structure
The notebook covers the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loading a dataset containing weekly ad spend on TV, radio, and newspaper, and corresponding sales data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, min-max analysis, and visualization of data trends.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing linear regression to estimate the impact of each marketing channel on sales.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics for the regression model and insights on the effectiveness of different ad channels.
5. **Recommendations**: Using the model's results to recommend budget allocations for maximizing sales.
